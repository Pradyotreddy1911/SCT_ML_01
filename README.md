This project focuses on predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The objective of this project is to explore the relationship between these features and the price of houses, and to build a simple yet effective baseline predictive model.
The implementation was carried out using Python with libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model. The workflow involved collecting and cleaning the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and correlations, training a Linear Regression model, and finally evaluating its performance using metrics such as RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error.
The analysis revealed that house prices are highly influenced by square footage, while the number of bedrooms and bathrooms also contribute but to a lesser extent. The Linear Regression model provided a good starting point for prediction, though there is potential to improve accuracy by experimenting with advanced machine learning models such as Random Forests or XGBoost.
This repository contains the dataset, Jupyter notebooks with the analysis, and Python scripts for model training. Future improvements could include hyperparameter tuning, testing multiple regression models, and deploying the model through Flask or Streamlit to allow users to make predictions interactively.
